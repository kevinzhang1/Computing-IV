Your name: Kevin Zhang

Hours to complete assignment: 4 hours

/**********************************************************************
 *  Briefly discuss the assignment itself and what you accomplished.
 **********************************************************************/
I had to encrypt an image and then decrypt it. I managed to write code for the transform function and the main function and Makefile but I couldn't get it to work.


 /**********************************************************************
 *  Discuss one or more key algorithms, data structures, or 
 *  OO designs that were central to the assignment.
 **********************************************************************/

The transform function is important because without it the image cannot be encrypted and decrypted.

/**********************************************************************
 *  Briefly explain the workings of the features you implemented.
 *  Include code excerpts.
 **********************************************************************/

The FibLFSR is basically the same as the ps1a. The transform function takes a image address and a FibLFSR and then uses the FibLFSR to encrypt or decrypt the image. It then displays the original image on one side and the encrypted one on the other.

 /**********************************************************************
 *  Briefly explain what you learned in the assignment.
 **********************************************************************/

I learned the concepts of encryption, its usefulness to society and how it can be used as a tool of cybersecurity.

/**********************************************************************
 *  List whatever help (if any) you received from the instructor,
 *  classmates, or anyone else.
 **********************************************************************/

Only help from the tutoring center.

/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe any serious problems you encountered.  
 *  If you didn't complete any part of any assignment, 
 *  the things that you didn't do, or didn't get working.                  
 **********************************************************************/

I wasn't able to debug and get the code to work.

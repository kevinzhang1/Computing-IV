# Computing-IV

PS0- this assignment had us write a short C++ program using SFML so that we can get familiar with it.

PS1a- this assignment had us implement a linear feedback shift register

PS1b- this assignment had us encode (or encrypt) an image using the linear feedback shift register and then decode (or decrypt) it again.

PS2- this assignment had us use SFML to implement recursive graphics in the form of a pythagoras tree

PS3- this assignment had us simulate a universe with planets using SFML

PS4a- this assignment had us simulate plucking a guitar string using the Karplus-Strong algorithm

PS4b- this assignment had us implement the Karplus-Strong guitar string simulation, and generate a stream of string samples for audio playback under keyboard control.

PS5- this assignment had us write a program to compute the optimal sequence alignment of two DNA strings.

PS6- this assignment had us create a program to analyze an input text for transitions between k-grams (a fixed number of characters) and the following letter and produce a probabilistic model of the text given a particular k-gram series of letters and what letters follow at what probabilities
